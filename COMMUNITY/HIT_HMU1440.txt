Media Info:
    Name: HMU1440 - 1.44 MB 3.5" Harold Media Unit
    Document version: 1.1
    
    
Description:
    The HMU1440 is the latest effort on the part of Harold Innovation
    Technologies to futurise the computing landscape of tomorrow; today!
    It is a high-density, double-sided magnetic storage device.  That's right, 
    it uses MAGNETS to store DATA.  Isn't technology amazing?
    
    It packs a whopping 1,440 512-word sectors into 80 beautifully delineated 
    tracks for a total stuff-icity of 1,474,560 octets.
    
    It also comes complete with a precision Write Lock slide-switch to protect 
    your many and varied files and a super high-quality Label, pre-lined for 
    your convenience and compatible with most writing implements on the market 
    today!  It is also available in a wide variety of colors including Blue and 
    White, but NOT Red.
    
    This disc is of such high quality of construction and design that it can 
    only be reliably WRITTEN to by Harold Innovation Technologies' HMD2043 
    Harold Media Drive.  However, this disc is of such high quality of 
    construction and design that it can be reliably READ from by even the most 
    basic and technologically backward of disk drives.
    
    So enjoy, and may this happy little disk provide you years of faithful 
    service before inexplicably failing, but not so fast that you cannot buy a 
    new disk and save almost all of your data.

Specification:
    Data surfaces: 2
    Tracks: 80
    Sectors per track: 18
    Total sectors: 1440
    
    Note: sectors are spread across both data surfaces; specifically, even bits 
    of a sector are stored on the "top" data surface, odd bits on the "bottom" 
    data surface.  This doubles effective read/write speed.
